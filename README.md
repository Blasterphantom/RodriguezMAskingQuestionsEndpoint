# RodriguezMAskingQuestionsEndpoint
#Open Postman, run debug in vs code, copy paste url from debug console in vs code: ie. https://localhost:7021. After you do that, add /endpoint/asking to the end, and then your name with a slash before it, and then the time you woke up with a slash before it. Press send and the console should output your name with the time you woke up at!!

#Peer review - Griffin Parker - This program works exactly as it should. It takes the user's name and the time they woke up through the URL The code looks organized and makes sense. Well Done!!
